## Activity 04: Debugging Practice

### Task

Complete the TODOs in the Python files to fix the broken code. Work through each file in order: `syntax_errors.py`, `runtime_errors.py`, and `logic_errors.py`. These examples include **nested for loops** and **while loops** from Week 4!

> 🐛 **Debugging Reference**: Review the Week 5 Debugging Slides for strategies and error types.

> 🔧 **Testing Your Fixes**: Run each file in VS Code to test your solutions. Make one small change at a time and test frequently.

### Learning Objectives 

**Debugging Skills:**
- ✅ Identify and fix **syntax errors** in nested loops
- ✅ Handle **runtime exceptions** in while loops and nested structures
- ✅ Locate and correct **logic errors** in complex loop patterns
- ✅ Read and interpret **error messages** for loop-related issues

**Problem-Solving Skills:**
- ✅ Apply systematic debugging strategies to **nested for loops**
- ✅ Debug **while loop** conditions and infinite loop problems
- ✅ Use **print statements** for tracing loop execution
- ✅ Test code incrementally with complex control structures

## Grading Rubric

This activity is assessed on a **pass/fail basis**:

- **1 point**: Awarded if 50% or more of the program functionality is completed
