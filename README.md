# Activity 4: Debugging Practice

## Overview

In this activity, you will practice debugging different types of Python errors. You will work with syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors, applying the strategies covered in the Week 5 slides.

## Instructions

1. **Work in pairs or small groups** (2-3 people)
2. **Read each buggy code example** in the files below
3. **Identify the type of error** (syntax, runtime, or logic)
4. **Fix the code** and test your solution
5. **Explain to your partner** what was wrong and how you fixed it

## Files to Debug

### Part 1: Syntax Errors (5 minutes)
- `syntax_errors.py` - Fix the code structure problems

### Part 2: Runtime Errors (8 minutes)
- `runtime_errors.py` - Handle exceptions that crash the program

### Part 3: Logic Errors (7 minutes)
- `logic_errors.py` - Find and fix incorrect results

## How to Work

1. **Read the error message carefully** (if there is one)
2. **Identify the line number** where the problem occurs
3. **Understand what the code is trying to do**
4. **Make one small change at a time**
5. **Test after each change**

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:
- Recognize different types of Python errors
- Read and interpret error messages
- Apply systematic debugging strategies
- Fix common programming mistakes
- Explain debugging steps to others

## Getting Help

- **Ask your partner** first - explaining helps both of you learn
- **Raise your hand** for instructor or TL assistance
- **Use print statements** to see what your variables contain
- **Test small pieces** of code to isolate problems

## When You're Done

- **Compare solutions** with other groups
- **Discuss different approaches** to fixing the same problem
- **Reflect** on which types of errors were hardest to find
- **Practice explaining** your debugging process
